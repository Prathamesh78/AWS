# AWS Lambda Overview

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. This README.md file provides an overview of AWS Lambda and how it works.

## How AWS Lambda Works

AWS Lambda follows a simple yet powerful architecture that allows you to run code in response to events. Here's how it works:

1. **Event Sources**: Events trigger the execution of Lambda functions. These events can come from various sources, such as Amazon S3 uploads, Amazon DynamoDB updates, API Gateway requests, Amazon SNS notifications, or custom events generated by other AWS services.

2. **Lambda Function**: You write your application code as a Lambda function. A Lambda function is a piece of code that performs a specific task. It can be written in multiple programming languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and more.

3. **Event Processing**: When an event occurs, AWS Lambda automatically invokes the corresponding Lambda function. The function then processes the event, performs the necessary computations or operations, and generates a response.

4. **Scalability**: AWS Lambda automatically scales the execution environment to handle incoming requests. It provisions resources as needed and manages concurrency to ensure that your functions can handle a high volume of requests without manual intervention.

5. **Billing**: With AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time consumed by your functions. There are no upfront costs or minimum fees. You are charged based on the number of requests and the duration of function execution, measured in milliseconds.
