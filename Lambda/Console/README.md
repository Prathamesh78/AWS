# AWS Lambda Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to create and configure a Lambda function using the AWS Management Console.

## 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console:

   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Sign in to your AWS account.

## 2. Navigate to AWS Lambda:

   - Choose the appropriate option for creating the function:
     - **Author from scratch**: Start from an empty function.

## 4. Write Code and Test:

   - In the Lambda function dashboard, you'll see an inline code editor.
   - Write your function code in the editor.
